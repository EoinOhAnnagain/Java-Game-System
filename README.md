# Java-Game-System
Game system project from my Java module at UCD

Thank you for taking the opportunity to look through my project. The folder gameProject contains all of the java files to run the project. 
This is a comand line interface game system. To begin run the file Start.java. In the process of doing so you will find that multiple .txt files are generated for storing player and game data. 

The game is designed to be somewhat unforgiving if you do not win. Loosing all your points will result in your player being locked out of the game. You will still be able to play using other player characters though. Of note is that there is a hidden option in the systems main menu. When choosing from all the options displayed you can enter the Konami code 'UUDDLRLRBA' in order to play a hiden game that adjusts a multiplyer based on if you win or loose. 

Also present in the repository are the ULM diagram showing all the methods and how the classes and subclasses relate to one another, and the report submitted which explains how aspects of the system work in greater detail. 

Thank you for taking the time to look at this repo.
